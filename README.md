[Packer](https://packer.io/) templates and scripts to build **[MY](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/vadviktor/boxes/u1404x64)** flavoured [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) based [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) boxes for [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

Note: I tried to support [VMWare Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/) based images too but eventually lost interest in that technology. If you are interested, dig through the commit history and you'll find some information to build your own.
